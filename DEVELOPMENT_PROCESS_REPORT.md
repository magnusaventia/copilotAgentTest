## ?? Development Journey Analysis

### **Phase 1: Initial Concept and Setup**

#### **User's First Prompt**
> *"browser did not open automatically, I navigated to the url myself. this needs fixing"*

**Prompt Quality Assessment: ????? (3/5)**

**Strengths:**
- Clear problem statement
- Specific issue identified
- Direct and concise

**Areas for Improvement:**
- No context about the application type
- Missing information about development environment
- No mention of operating system or browser preferences
- Could have included current launch configuration

**Improved Prompt Example:**
```
"I'm developing an ASP.NET Core web application on Windows 11. When I run 
'dotnet run', the application starts successfully but the browser doesn't 
open automatically. I have to manually navigate to localhost:5000. 

Current setup:
- VS Code as IDE
- Chrome as default browser
- Project uses .NET 8.0

Could you help me configure automatic browser launching? I'd prefer it to 
work across different development environments."
```

#### **AI Response Analysis**
The AI correctly identified multiple potential causes:
1. Missing/incorrect launchSettings.json configuration
2. Browser launching mechanism issues
3. Cross-platform compatibility concerns

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Enhanced launchSettings.json with multiple profiles
- Added fallback browser launcher in Program.cs
- Cross-platform browser detection (Windows, macOS, Linux)

---

### **Phase 2: Image Loading Issues**

#### **User's Second Prompt**
> *"images are not loading, could you have a look?"*

**Prompt Quality Assessment: ????? (2/5)**

**Strengths:**
- Identified a functional issue
- Requested investigation

**Areas for Improvement:**
- No error messages or console output provided
- No description of expected vs actual behavior
- Missing information about image file locations
- No mention of browser developer tools inspection

**Improved Prompt Example:**
```
"The quiz images aren't displaying in my web application. Here's what I'm seeing:

Current behavior:
- Image placeholders show but no actual images load
- Browser console shows 404 errors for image files
- Images are located in the Images/ folder at project root

Expected behavior:
- Questions should display relevant images
- Images should be served from wwwroot/images/

Could you help me debug the image loading issue? I can provide console 
error logs if needed."
```

#### **AI Response Analysis**
The AI performed comprehensive debugging:
1. Investigated folder structure (Images/ vs wwwroot/images/)
2. Identified path mismatch issues (/Images/ vs /images/)
3. Discovered incomplete image downloads (.crdownload files)
4. Created CSS-based placeholder solution

**Key Learning**: The AI provided both immediate fixes and fallback solutions, demonstrating good problem-solving methodology.

- Design improvement request

**Areas for Improvement:**
- No specific WCAG level mentioned (A, AA, AAA)
- Missing target user groups or accessibility needs
- No mention of testing requirements
- Could specify browser/device priorities

**Improved Prompt Example:**
```
"Please implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for this quiz application, with 
specific focus on:

Accessibility Requirements:
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast compliance
- Focus management

Layout Requirements:
- Full browser window utilization
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Modern CSS Grid/Flexbox layout

Target users include students with visual impairments, so accessibility 
is critical. Could you also document the compliance features for future 
reference?"
```

#### **AI Response Analysis**
The AI delivered comprehensive WCAG implementation:

**Accessibility Features Added:**
- Skip links for screen readers
- ARIA labels and semantic markup
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys
- High contrast and dark mode support
- Focus indicators (3px orange outline)
- Live regions for dynamic updates
- Proper heading hierarchy

**Layout Improvements:**

### **Phase 4: Functional Issues**

#### **User's Fourth Prompt**
> *"the point counter and question tracker have stopped working"*

**Prompt Quality Assessment: ????? (3/5)**

**Strengths:**
- Specific functionality issue identified
- Clear problem statement

**Areas for Improvement:**
- No description of when it stopped working
- Missing browser console error information
- No mention of testing steps performed
- Could include expected vs actual behavior

**Improved Prompt Example:**
```
"The score tracking functionality has broken - here's what I'm observing:

Issues:
- Score display shows 'Poeng: 0 | Sporsmal: 0/12' throughout quiz
- Counter doesn't increment after correct answers
- Question number doesn't advance

Browser console shows:
[Include any JavaScript errors]

This started happening after the WCAG implementation. Could you help 
debug the JavaScript score updating mechanism?"
```

#### **AI Response Analysis**
The AI systematically debugged the issue:
1. Identified Norwegian character encoding problems in JavaScript
2. Fixed session management logic
3. Simplified JavaScript with error handling
4. Added comprehensive debugging logging

---

### **Phase 5: Quiz Loop Issue**

#### **User's Fifth Prompt**
> *"still not working, and I also noticed the quiz is a never ending loop. After the 12 questions are answered, the game should be over"*

**Prompt Quality Assessment: ????? (4/5)**

**Strengths:**
- Multiple issues identified clearly
- Specific expected behavior described
- Previous issue acknowledged

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Could include current routing/navigation flow
- Missing application logs or error details

**Improved Prompt Example:**
```
"Two issues with the quiz functionality:

1. Score counter still not updating (from previous issue)
2. Quiz doesn't end after 12 questions - it loops infinitely

Expected flow:
Question 1 ? Question 2 ? ... ? Question 12 ? Results Page

Current flow:
Question 1 ? Question 2 ? ... ? Question 12 ? Question 1 (loops)

Could you check both the scoring JavaScript and the navigation logic 
in Quiz.cshtml.cs?"
```

#### **AI Response Analysis**
The AI addressed both issues comprehensively:

**Score Counter Fix:**
- Removed problematic Norwegian characters
- Simplified JavaScript with proper error handling
- Added debugging console messages

**Loop Issue Fix:**
- Fixed session management in Quiz.cshtml.cs
- Improved OnGetNext() method logic
- Added proper quiz completion checks
- Fixed routing to Results page

**Strengths:**
- Specific accessibility concern
- Focus on compliance standards

**Areas for Improvement:**
- No specific WCAG violations mentioned
- Missing accessibility testing results
- Could include target assistive technologies

**Improved Prompt Example:**
```
"The final score display on the Results page has accessibility issues:

Potential WCAG violations:
- Color contrast may be insufficient
- Missing ARIA labels for score significance
- No keyboard focus management
- Screen reader compatibility unclear

Could you make the final score display fully WCAG 2.1 AA compliant? 
Please include documentation of the accessibility features implemented."
```

#### **AI Response Analysis**
The AI delivered exceptional WCAG compliance:

**Implemented Features:**
- High contrast color schemes (4.5:1+ ratios)
- Comprehensive ARIA labeling
- Keyboard navigation with focus indicators
- Screen reader announcements
- Dark mode and high contrast support
- Semantic HTML structure
- Touch-friendly design

## ?? Key Lessons for Better AI Prompting

### **1. Context is King**
**Bad**: "Fix this error"  
**Good**: "I'm getting a 404 error when loading images in my ASP.NET Core app. The images are in /Images/ but the app expects them in /wwwroot/images/. Console shows: [specific error]"

### **2. Include Environment Details**
Always mention:
- Operating system
- Development tools
- Framework versions
- Browser preferences
- Target audience needs

### **3. Describe Expected vs Actual Behavior**
```
Expected: Score increments after correct answers
Actual: Score stays at 0 throughout quiz
When: Started after WCAG implementation
```

### **4. Provide Error Messages and Logs**
Include:
- Browser console errors
- Server logs
- Stack traces
- Warning messages

### **5. Specify Requirements Clearly**
Instead of "make it accessible", say:
- "Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance"
- "Support screen readers (NVDA, JAWS)"
- "Ensure keyboard navigation"
- "Test with high contrast mode"
